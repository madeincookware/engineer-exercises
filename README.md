# Made In Cookware - Engineering screen

## Instructions

Each subfolder in `/exercises` – just 1 for now – has a src file and a spec file. In order to complete your screening, just do this:
1. Clone or fork this repo to your own github account
2. Implement whatever function(s) are needed in your assigned `exercise.ts` file, in order to get the specs passing.
3. *Do not* modify the spec file.
4. Commit and push your changes to your own cloned repo, then let us know you're ready for review! Obviously, include a link to your implementation.
