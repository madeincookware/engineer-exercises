# Made In - Engineering exercises

## Instructions

1. Clone down this repo.
2. Inside of `/exercises/ex_1` you'll see a src and a spec file. The goal is to implement the required logic in the src file, in order to get the specs to pass.
3. The src file (`.ts`) will have some light documentation on what you're supposed to implement. But be aware, the ultimate source of truth for what you're supposed to build will be _the spec file_. There may be certain intricacies that you can only discover by looking at the spec, in other words.
4. It is assumed that you'll be using the script in `package.json` to run the spec. If you don't know how to do this, google it ðŸ˜‰
5. It is also assumed that you will not modify the spec file. That's cheating.
6. Once you get all specs passing, commit and push your implementation to a new private repo of your own creation. E.g., under your own github account. 
7. Finally, just send us the link to your solution, and we'll review it.
