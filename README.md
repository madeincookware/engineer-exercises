# Made In - Engineering exercises

## Instructions

Each subfolder in `/exercises` – just 1 for now – has a src file and a spec file. Your interviewer / hiring manager will tell you which of these you need to complete. To complete the exercise(s), just do this:
1. Clone down this repo.
2. Implement whatever function(s) are needed in your assigned `exercise.ts` file, in order to get the specs passing.
3. *Do not* modify the spec file.
4. Commit and push your implementation(s) to a new private repo of your own creation – e.g. under your own github account.
5. When you're ready for review, just send the link to your hiring manager and we'll take a look!
